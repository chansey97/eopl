; Write the following procedures for calculating on a bintree (definition
; 1.1.7): leaf and interior-node, which builds bintrees, leaf?, which tests
; whether a bintree is a leaf, and lson, rson and contents-of, which extract
; components of a node. contents-of should work on both leaves end interior
; nodes.

;; Definition 1.1.7 (binary tree)
