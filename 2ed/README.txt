Two ways to run these examples and tests in Racket:

1. Use DrRacket

   Open a file via DrRacket, e.g. ~/eopl/2ed/chapter8/cps/basic/tests/do-tests.scm
   
   Select the Language -> Choose Language -> Other Languages -> R5RS

   Run

2. Use plt-r5rs

   e.g.

   ~/eopl/2ed/chapter8/cps/basic/tests> plt-r5rs.exe do-tests.scm
